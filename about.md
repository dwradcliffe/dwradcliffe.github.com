description: Brief history of David Radcliffe.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Internet Development from Indiana Wesleyan University in April 2009.

As a freshman in college I was inducted into the upperclassmen Computer Majorsâ€™ Lab.

The summer after that first year of school I started a company doing mostly web development and continued cultivating the business through my senior year. I developed many websites using PHP, MySQL and a variety of other client and server software. I worked for clients all over the country, analyzing, planning and developing solutions to fit their needs.

I have developed websites and software on many stacks and technologies.

Currently I develop on a 16" MacBook Pro, using VS Code and iTerm2. My current languages of choice are Ruby and Go.
