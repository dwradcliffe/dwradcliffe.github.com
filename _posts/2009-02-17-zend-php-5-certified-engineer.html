title: Zend PHP 5 Certified Engineer
---
 
I took the Zend PHP 5 Certification exam today and I passed! That makes me the newest Zend PHP 5 Certified Engineer in the world! (I know its a mouthful so I'll understand when you don't refer to that title). This means I am certified to know the syntax and usage of the PHP language. On to bigger and better things!
