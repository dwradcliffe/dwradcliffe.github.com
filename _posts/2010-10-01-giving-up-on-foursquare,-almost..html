title: Giving up on foursquare, almost.
---
 
<p>I've been an avid fourquare user for some time now. I spent the first few months adding every venue I visited and collecting mayorships like it was my job.</p>  <p>But it wasn’t. And I’m done.</p>  <p>I’ve come to a place where I just don't see any benefit. Sure, there are the occasional venues that offer discounts. But who has time to visit that specific restaurant every day for 3 weeks just to get a dollar off their meal? I sure don’t. As more and more users join, it becomes harder and harder to be mayor, which dilutes the benefits even more.</p>  <p>Granted, I’m not constantly traveling and going to meetings all across the city, country, or world like some people I know. That would make for a much more interesting data graph. For me, my foursquare checkins Monday through Friday consisted of not much more than work, home, and an occasional errand. Not very interesting.</p>  <p>So I’ve stopped checking in wherever I go. The foursquare app no longer needs a parking spot on my home screen. I don’t feel the burden of 'having to checkin' before I do anything.</p>  <p>That’s not to say that I closed my account and I’m purging my relationship with foursquare. I still may use it from time to time. When I'm on vacation it's still a usefull and interesting tool to see where I've been. (see <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/07/foursquare-google-maps-mashup.html">Fred Wison's write-up on this</a>)</p>  <p>I wonder …. am I the only one who has come to this conclusion? I doubt it.</p>
