title: Adeline Records Store
---
 
<p>I recently wrapped up another project and after the initial traffic surge I'm happy to share with the world.</p>

<p>Adeline Records wanted a <a href="http://store.adelinerecords.net">new online store</a>. They had been using x-cart and although quite popular, it is a mess to administrate and the default templates are quite ugly. It wasn't hard to see why they wanted to make the change.</p>

<p>After a bit of research we decided to go with <a href="http://spreecommerce.com">Spree</a>. Magento was too much and almost everything else we found was old and outdated.  Spree, unlike most open source e-commerce packages, runs on Ruby on Rails. This was one of my first RoR projects so it was a bit of a learning experience. Spree is a great project and has TONS of flexibility to change things around to just the way you need.</p>

<p>It was a fun project and hopefully it will continue to grow and change. I look forward to doing more Spree development soon.</p>
