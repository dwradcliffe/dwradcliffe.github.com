title: Over to the dark side. Or, I bought a Mac.

<p>If you know me well you will know that I have been against Apple and Mac computers for as long as I can remember. I wont get into all the reasons why, but I had my reasons and I stuck to it.</p>  <p>Until yesterday.</p>  <p>Last night after work I went out and bought my first Apple computer. (First apple anything, actually.) I bought a nice 15" MacBook Pro.</p>  <p>I've been developing with some new technologies and I just kept running into a wall on my Windows machine. A lot of these issues I know <em>just work</em> on a Mac and I'll actually be able to get some work done.</p>  <p>I'm excited to get it up and running and see first-hand what it's capable of. I'll try to post the key things I use or packages that are super helpful.</p>
