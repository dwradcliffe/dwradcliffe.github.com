title: Installing the mysql gem on Ubuntu
---
 
If you're trying to install the mysql gem on Ubuntu (and possibly other distros) you need several packages installed prior to installing the gem. I keep forgetting so here they are. Hopefully this will help someone else too.

<pre>
$ apt-get install mysql-client
$ apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev
$ gem install mysql
</pre>
