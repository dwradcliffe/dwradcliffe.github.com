title: Joining Trabian Technology
---

I've been doing some contract work for [Trabian Technology](http://www.trabian.com) for several months now but as of November 1st I'm officially part of the Trabian Team. I've enjoyed working with them and building the Trabian software and infrastructure and I'm excited about the work we're going to do going forward.
