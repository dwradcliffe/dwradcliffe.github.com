* Geocities

  _yay first website!_

* Cheap shared web hosting with some crappy html

* Blogger/Wordpress.com

  _real blog!_
  
* [self-hosted] Wordpress

  _only a fool uses someone else's blog service_
  
  _and I can use all these awesome plugins!_

* Jekyll [on GitHub]

  _dynamic? pssh. static is so freaking fast!!_

* Tumblr

  _it just works. nuf said._
