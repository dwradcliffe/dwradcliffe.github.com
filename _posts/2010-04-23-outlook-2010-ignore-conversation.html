title: Outlook 2010 Ignore Conversation
---
 
Here is a really neat new feature of Outlook 2010! In addition to the threading features built into this version, outlook now has a tiny little "Ignore" button at the top left of the ribbon.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-262" title="outlook-2010-ignore" src="/images/outlook-2010-ignore.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="147" />

This button will delete the selected email and <strong><em>also delete any future emails</em></strong> in the same conversation! Â This could be extremely useful in situations where reply all is overused. This happens in corporate environments all the time. Someone replies to everyone and soon there are 15 other emails replying to everyone. If you don't want to see them, now you don't have to!
