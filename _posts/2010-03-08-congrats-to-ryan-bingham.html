title: Congrats to Ryan Bingham
---
 
Tonight was the 82nd Oscars. I've never really paid much attention to events like this before but tonight I was glued to the TV watching to see who would win. One of my clients, Ryan Bingham, was nominated for Best Original Song for “The Weary Kind”, the theme from the film “Crazy Heart”.

If you also watched tonight you will already know that <strong>Ryan won</strong>! I would like to congratulate Ryan Bingham for his excellent work over the past year and and congrats also to his crew and team that helped make this possible.
