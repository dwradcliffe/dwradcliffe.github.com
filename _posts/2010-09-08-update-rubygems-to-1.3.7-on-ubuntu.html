title: Update Rubygems to 1.3.7 on Ubuntu
---
 
This isn't the first or only place this is on the web but I keep forgetting so I'm posting this to remind myself. Maybe it will help someone else too.

The problem is that the packaged version of rubygems is stuck at 1.3.5 and rails 3.0 requires 1.3.6.  Here is the easy fix...

<code>sudo gem install rubygems-update --no-rdoc --no-ri</code>
<code>sudo update_rubygems</code>

Then you can use <code>gem -v</code> to check!
