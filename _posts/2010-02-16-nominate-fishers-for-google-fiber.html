title: Nominate Fishers for Google Fiber
---
 
Earlier this week I <a href="http://www.dwradcliffe.com/blog/2010/02/google-fiber">blogged about how Google announced their Fiber internet access experiment</a>. Later this year Google will pick one or more communities to build an experimental ultra-high-speed fiber network. This will deliver internet to residents at over 100 times faster than the current high-speed internet providers.

Since this post I have received amazing feedback from my local community and I have started working with the help of a few others to push this initiative along.

<span style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold;">We want Google Fiber to come to Fishers, Indiana.</span>
<em>And we can do it.</em>

This is a two-fold plan. First the residents and anyone else that cares. And second, the town and it's official representatives.

<strong>Nominate Fishers</strong> - This is the most important. Google has a quick form for you to fill out to nominate Fishers and explain why Fishers would be a good choice. <a href="http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/user/launch_exhibit_b">http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/user/launch_exhibit_b</a>

<strong>Join our Facebook Group</strong> - We created a Facebook Group to show Google and the town of Fishers just how much we want this. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=462275585022">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=462275585022</a>

<strong>Share</strong> - this post, the Facebook group, and the Google form with all your friends and neighbors.

<strong>Contact</strong> - anyone you know in the Fishers town government and tell them you want this.

Google has specifically asked for an official response from the community. Google wants an authoritative voice to ask for this and tell Google about our community. The online forms can be found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/user/list_applications">https://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/user/list_applications</a>. Many other cities and communities have already begun this process and we want Fishers to have a chance. This will be a huge benefit to the community. It will be great for Fishersâ€™ publicity and image. It will probably bring jobs to Fishers.  If you have any questions about what this is all about please <a href="http://www.dwradcliffe.com/contact">contact </a>me and I will be happy to explain it.
