<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.netbanker.com/2010/10/launching_will_ebilling_startup_doxo_become_a_household_word.html">read about Doxo</a> on the netbanker blog. This service aims to be your online hub for organizing paper - bills, statements, receipts and other notices. This looked interesting so I found an invite and signed up.</p>  <p>For those of you who appreciate good web apps with a good user interface, you will probably like Doxo. The UI is nice and clean and easy to use. There isn't a whole lot of extra fluff getting in the way. In fact, there really aren't many features.</p>  <p>Once your account is created you are asked to add accounts or providers. The search and filter feels a lot like Mint. It was easy to find and add providers that I use and would like to use inside Doxo. An added bonus (for the earth) was that after I added 12 providers, Doxo planted a tree in my honor. Not really a feature, but it makes good sense as the app aims to reduce actual paper usage.</p> <img alt="Doxo interface" src="http://dwradcliffe-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2010/11/doxo-todo.png" />   <p>Once my accounts are added they are listed along the left side of the screen. The main section has two important tabs: To Do items and Filed Docs. The to-do items tab contains any bills that you still need to pay and once they have been paid, (or if they are not a bill) they move into the filed docs tab. You can view by a specific account or all accounts aggregated together.</p>  <p>Up until yesterday, if you wanted to use Doxo to organize your paper-filled life, you would have to possibly scan and upload each document to the Doxo web interface. This is a little clunky, as I don't have the time or equipment to effectively scan and upload EVERY document I have filed away. Doxo's plan is to partner with providers to automatically deliver your documents to Doxo. No scanning. No uploading.</p> <img alt="Doxo + Sprint" src="http://dwradcliffe-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2010/11/doxo-sprint.png" />   <p>Yesterday Doxo announced their first commercial partner: Sprint. Users can now add their sprint account and seamlessly receive their statements and other documents directly in their Doxo account. This is a great first step for Doxo. I hope to see other providers added quickly.</p>  <p><a href="http://doxo.com">Doxo</a> is a great idea, a great interface and has great possibility. However, it remains to be seen whether or not it will really provide the service it claims will revolutionize the industry. I hope it does.</p>  <p><span style="color: #888888">You should <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dwradcliffe">follow me on twitter</a> @dwradcliffe.</span></p>
