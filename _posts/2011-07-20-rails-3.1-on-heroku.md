title: Rails 3.1 (rc4) on Heroku
---
 
I've been upgrading one of my apps to Rails 3.1 (rc4) this week and I attempted to deploy it to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) today. At first it was a miserable failure but I've been able to work through the bugs and its running well now. I'll highlight the things I found so that maybe it won't take you as long as it took me.

## New Relic
New Relic does not work with rails 3.1 rc4. If you're using it (you should be), just comment out the gem for now. I'm sure they will get it working by full release time.

"We do not work with the Rails 3.1 release candidate (RC4)."

## PostgreSQL
For some reason I need to specify the pg gem myself. Just add the following to your Gemfile:
```
gem 'pg', :group => :production
```

## JavaScript interpreter
Rails 3.1 uses sprockets (which is awesome) which uses execjs which requires a javascript interpreter to run properly. There are several options but it seems that the only current option that works on Heroku is "The Ruby Racer" heroku build. You can add the following to your Gemfile:
```
gem 'therubyracer-heroku', '0.8.1.pre3', :group => :production
```
