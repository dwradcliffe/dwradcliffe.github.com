title: On Apple's iPad
---
 
Apple recently announced their newest product, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>. Every blog now has a review, and either loves it or hates it. I'm going to take a different approach and just link to a few really good reviews and points of view. I hope you enjoy these, as they are hopefully a little different than most of the common reviews.

I'll try to update this list as I find new ones.
