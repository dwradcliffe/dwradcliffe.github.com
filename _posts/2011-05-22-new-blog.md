I've been using WordPress for quite a while and it's served me well. But it's time to move on. I have no need for the bulk of what Wordpress offers. I live in the command line by day and try as I'm neck deep in ruby projects it only makes sense to try out one of the simple Ruby/Rack powered blog engines. I've heard lots of great things about toto (http://cloudhead.io/toto) and I was almost ready to give that a try but I wanted to take the change one step further. Toto runs a very thin Rack app. I wanted something that didn't need to run any kind of app.

The other option I was looking at was Jekyll (http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It's a similar concept except it renders the entire site at once into a local directory. There's nothing to run on the server - it's just static html files.

So, I'm giving it a try. I'm using github to host the site for now. It's free - so why not?

I was able to import my old WordPress posts without too much trouble but the formatting is a bit off. Maybe if I have time I'll fix them later.

That's all for now.
