title: Emotions of those we serve
---
 
This morning I was reading a post by <a href="http://bentilly.blogspot.com/">Ben Tilly</a> about addressing emotions in web forms. He has a great idea. Actually, Kevin Hale, the CEO ofÂ <a href="http://wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a> had a great idea.
<blockquote>In the process of trying to fill out a ticket you have the option of reporting your emotional state. Which can be anything from "Excited" to "Angry".</blockquote>
I wonder if this idea could be implemented on any of our member-facing support forms or surveys? I think this idea is rock solid and might help make our members happier. A follow-up survey after the request was completed would check the emotions again. Is the member happy now? If not - we are doing something very wrong.
