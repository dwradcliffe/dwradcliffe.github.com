The day has come, our wedding pictures have finally arrived. Well, arrived to our screen.

<a href="http://twitter.com/jrvanandel">Jeremy</a> has been working hard to go through our thousands of photos and he has now opened up the gates and we can look at all of them. There are a few different places you can look, starting with Facebook and his blog post and then also a slideshow (~400 photos) and the full gallery (~850 photos). The full gallery will also allow you to purchase prints of many sizes if you wish. Enjoy!
