title: jQuery 1.4 Released!
---
 
Today, the jQuery team released the next version of their revolutionary JavaScript framework. Today is also the 4th birthday of jQuery although it has only recently (in the last year or so) become almost standard among web developers. jQuery has made developing in JavaScript fun again, for me, and hopefully you too.

You can read all about it on the <a href="http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14">14 days of jQuery site</a>.  The links to download the files are right on that page, or you can also use the following links:
