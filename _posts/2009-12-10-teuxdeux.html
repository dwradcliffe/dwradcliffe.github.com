It seems like these days everyone is always finding some new product or tool to help get things done.  There are many apps out there - a lot of good and a lot of bad apps.  I recently found one of the best.  The problem is simple - we can't keep track of what we need to do - so the solution should be simple too.

Enter TeuxDeux:

TeuxDeux is probably the simplest to-do app you have ever seen.  It consists of a list, for each day. That's it. (Well, there's also a "someday" list too.)  Sign-up and give it a try. You will be amazed at how simple and usable this app is.
