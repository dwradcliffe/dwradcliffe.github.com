I use a lot of tools on a daily basis and I'd like to share a list of the best ones.

> Full disclosure, some of these links are affilate-type links and I might get something if you click. I promise these really are my top picks and if that bothers you, just google them instead.


## [Basecamp](http://try.37signals.com/333364)
Project management application.

## [Square](http://squareup.com)
Accept credit card payments from your smartphone.

## [Xero](http://www.xero.com)
Excellent accounting software. Kicks Quickbooks in the pants.

## [Trello](https://trello.com)
New one - realtime project management organization. Create lists and tasks. Assign team members. Comment, vote, upload, prioritize.

## [New Relic RPM](http://newrelic.extole.com/a/clk/3dHTP)
Performance monitoring and notification service. Awesome for fine tuning a web app.
