title: About David Radcliffe
---

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Internet Development from Indiana Wesleyan University in April 2009.

As a freshman in college I was inducted into the upperclassmen Computer Majorsâ€™ Lab.

The summer after that first year of school I started a company doing mostly web development and continued cultivating the business through my senior year. I have developed many websites using PHP, MySQL and a variety of other client and server software. I have worked for clients all over the country, analyzing, planning and developing solutions to fit their needs.

I have developed websites and software on the LAMP stack and Windows servers.

I have spent extensive time developing in the Microsoft Visual Studio environment, as well as the open source Eclipse environment.

I recently obtained my Zend PHP 5 Certification.

I am comfortable developing with PHP, MySQL, (X)HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, MooTools, MS-SQL, ASP.NET, C#, Silverlight, Flash, and ActionScript.

The software tools I most often use include:
Adobe: Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator, Bridge, ImageReady, Premiere Pro, Flash
Microsoft: Office, FrontPage, Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio 2010, Visio, Project
Platforms: Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows 7, Apple OS X, Windows Phone, Android
Browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome
Other: Eclipse, FileZilla, Putty, Firebug, ReSharper
